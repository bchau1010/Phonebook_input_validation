Regular expressions for <Person> and <Telephone #>

REQUIREMENT FOR INPUT #
    The following are some rules to follow for phone numbers:
    • The country code may or may not be preceded by a + which indicates that an international
    dialing prefix, such as 00 or 011, must be included when dialing. If not using the plus, the
    dialing prefix itself may be included.
    • Some organizations use 5-digit extensions only for dialing from one internal phone to
    another.
    • North American phone numbers dialed within the countries of North America use a
    country code of 1, have a 3-digit area code, and a 7-digit subscriber number. Calls to local
    numbers in the same area code may omit the area code if not in a metro area; therefore, a
    subscriber only format may be used. Acceptable entry for North American phone numbers
    are as follows:
        o <Subscriber Number> (e.g. 123-4567)
        o (<Area Code>)<Subscriber Number> (e.g. (670)123-4567)
        o <Area Code>-<Subscriber Number> (e.g. 670-123-4567)
        o 1-<Area Code>-<Subscriber Number> (e.g. 1-670-123-4567)
        o 1(<Area Code>)<Subscriber Number> (e.g. 1(670)123-4567)
        o <Area Code> <Subscriber Number> (e.g. 670 123 4567)
        o <Area Code>.<Subscriber Number> (e.g. 670.123.4567)
        o 1 <Area Code> <Subscriber Number> (e.g. 1 670 123 4567)
        o 1.<Area Code>.<Subscriber Number> (e.g. 1.670.123.4567)
    • Danish telephone numbers are 8 digits long, and normally written in four groups of two
    separated by spaces, AA AA AA AA. In recent years it has also become common to write
    them in two groups of four, AAAA AAAA. Also, allow dots instead of spaces. Denmark's
    country code is 45 and may be included as well for international formats.
    • Some notations use 2-digit area codes.
    • Some notations with 10 digits in two groups of five separated by either a space or a dot.
